# Matey Exporter

A Prometheus exporter for collecting and exposing metrics from Matey services.

## Description

Prometheus Matey Exporter enables monitoring of services used by virtual sailors of the seven seas, by collecting relevant metrics and exposing them in Prometheus format. This makes it easy to integrate Matey service monitoring into your existing Prometheus ecosystem.

The main difference from other Prometheus exporters is that Matey Exporter is designed to work with multiple services from a single exporter instance, as well as support a wider variety of services.

The project is still in early stages and missing a lot of supported metrics. Feel free to contribute and help improve it.

Currently supported services metrics and tested versions:
| Service  | Version |
|   ---    |  ---    |
| Radarr   |  ---    |
| Sonarr   |  ---    |
| Lidarr   |  ---    |
| Readarr  |  ---    |
| Prowlarr |  ---    |
| qBittorrent | 5.0.3  |
| Transmission| ---  |
| Deluge  |   2.1.1  |

## Data collection agent

Configuration snippets for data collecting agents.

Grafana Alloy:
```
prometheus.scrape "matey" {
  forward_to = [prometheus.remote_write.<prometheus_remote_write_component_name>.receiver,]
  scrape_interval = "30s"
  targets = [
    {
      "__address__" = "localhost:8000",
      "job" = "matey",
    },
  ]
}
```

Prometheus node exporter:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
- job_name: 'matey'
  scrape_interval: 30s
  static_configs:
  - targets: ['localhost:8000']
```
